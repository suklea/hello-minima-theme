Hello, Minima!


Welcome to markdown madness. We hope you **really** enjoy using good old text for writing.

Just type some [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
and jekyll will automatically turn it into hypertext markup language (HTML). *Simple as that.*

> Quote goes here.

A list:

- One
- Two
- Three

Some inline code `to_html` and a preformatted code block:

```
Kramdown::Document.new( 'Hello Markdown!' ).to_html
```
